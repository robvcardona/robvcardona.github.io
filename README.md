# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

## Current Design
This is my first portfolio wesbite, and with the knowledge I have, and the aesthetics I like, I wanted to keep it simple. However, I did not want to keep a simple column structure site, and included a 3 row site using Flexbox. The navigation and contact rows take up 50% of the sites real estate, which is split evenly between then two (25% each). For the main content section, which includes my name, about me, and projects, I have it with 50% of the sites real estate.

I am using Roboto Mono for the font, and created a few line dividers to help with the overall readability and aesthetics.

Clicking on my projects will reveal a quick summary of the project and it's intended purpose. There are no current projects here at the moment, as of Feb 2024. However, as I continue to learn, there will soon be projects that fulfill this section. I' not the biggest fan of posting codecademy's projects, but maybe I should to at least have something there.

Click on my socials will take you to my social media pages, including instagram, linkedin, and github.

For the ending section, "The Blog," currently, this is left blank. I plan on writing down my thoughts and ideas here... once I learn how to create a backend blog system.
